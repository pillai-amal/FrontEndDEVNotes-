-  CSS is linked to a html file using `<link>` for example
```html
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
	</head>
```
- css is link has two attributes `rel` and `href`
```css
	h1 {
		text-align: center;
		color: darkblue;
		font-weight: normal;
		text-decoration: underline;
	}
```
- here the `h1` is called the <i> selector </i> and what is inside the braces is the syle.
